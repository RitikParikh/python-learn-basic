For this we use shall
python3
#Ex:1 
username = 'Ritik'
username
//OutPut 'Ritik'
username = 'Ritik parikh'
username
//OutPut 'Ritik parikh'

#Ex:2
x = 10
y = x
y
//OutPut 10
x = 15
y
//OutPut 10


See in above variable y value has no change why it happen understand below
Python has works on immutable and mutable datatype
immutable means can't change 
mutable means data can be change
immutable data types are -> Integers, Floating-point numbers, Boolean, Strings, Tuples, Frozen Set, Bytes
mutable --> List, Set, Dictionary, Bytearray, Array

#But example 1 sees the username string change then it how be immutable
 -- So here Python internal working is variable never be use to allocate memory, actual on data allocate memory and variable reference them
 -- So what happens Ritik allocate memory then username reference to Ritik data, but when you type username = 'Ritik parikh' it create new memory and username reference to it 
    now in memory, two data is there one is "Ritik" and second is 'Ritik parikh' but "Ritik" is garbage value because no variable reference/point the data 
    and python has default garbage collector so it remove that data from the memory

#SO lets understand the ex 2
 -- Here memory assign to 10 that reference by x
 -- Now create new variable y that reference value is 10 so two variable reference same value
 -- now we create new memory for 15 and reference give to x so y is reference the value 10 but x reference new value 10 15

 So that variable dons;t allocate memory is reference to the value

 And all datatypes are objects
