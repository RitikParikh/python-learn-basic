    python code ----> Byte Code(Mostly hidden) ------> python VM

    - Code Compile to Byte Code (Low level and Platform Independent)
    - Byte Code Runs Faster (It is not instruct to hardware, it is the low level code tha Independent for every system)
    - .pyc files --> automated generates called Compiled python (Frozen Binaries)

> __pycache__
    
    - It represent Source Change & Python Version
        hello_world.cpython-312.pyc
    - Works only for imported files not on top level files

> Python Virtual machine PVM
    - Code Loop to iterate byte code
    - Run time engine
    - Also known as python interpreter

> Byte Code is not machine code code
    - Python specific interpretation
> More varites of python > cpython (Use for standard implementation), jython, iron python, stackless, pypy
